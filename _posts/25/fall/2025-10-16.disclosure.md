After a decade plus of listening to them, I had the chance to see Disclosure perform live. They rocked it. Played their hits with refreshing energy and invited instrumentalists that added layers of presence to their signature electronic grooves. Originally I was just looking up concerts for Villager who was supposed to open for them. But he didn't play. This also was my first time bringing my ultimate compact setup to a concert: Canon M2 paired with the f2 22mm - though I have further minified this setup. It's a great camera to have in the pocket when you don't want to look like you're bringing something pro to a venue. Luckily the bouncer recognized me from a event she was working earlier at Emerson College.
