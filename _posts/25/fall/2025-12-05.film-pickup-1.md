I picked up a mix of 35mm and Medium format rolls that I left too long sitting. If it weren’t for my iPhone photos, it would have been a huge challenge to figure out dates and locations. Perhaps waiting so long is also what made this pickup so sweet. Besides an experimental 110 roll with a toy camera, I haven’t developed a roll in 2 years! Seeing these made me miss shooting on film more than ever. I will fix my Pentax!
